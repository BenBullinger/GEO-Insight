# Data

Raw source datasets for Geo-Insight. None of the CSV/JSON files in this folder are tracked in git (too large for GitHub; ~270 MB total). The repository ships the **download script** and the **source manifest**; everyone reproduces their local data directory with one command.

## Reproducing the data

```bash
cd GEO-Insight

# Primary sources (~270 MB, stdlib only)
python3 Data/download.py                 # download missing files
python3 Data/download.py --check         # list what's present / missing
python3 Data/download.py --force         # re-download everything

# Third-party: INFORM Severity (~130 MB of xlsx + a 251 KB consolidated CSV)
python3 Data/Third-Party/DRMKC-INFORM/download.py
dashboard/.venv/bin/python Data/Third-Party/DRMKC-INFORM/consolidate.py
```

`./run.sh` at the repo root calls all four of these on first run. The primary downloader uses Python stdlib only; the consolidator needs the dashboard venv (pandas, openpyxl).

## Sources

### Primary (5 official sources from the challenge brief, in `sources.txt`)

1. [HNO — Humanitarian Needs Overview](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/global-hpc-hno) → `hno/`
2. [HRP — Humanitarian Response Plans](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/humanitarian-response-plans) → `hrp/`
3. [CoD-PS — Global subnational population](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ps-global) → `cod-ps/`
4. [FTS — Global requirements & funding](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/global-requirements-and-funding-data) → `fts/`
5. [CBPF Pooled Funds Data Hub](https://cbpf.data.unocha.org) → `cbpf/` (resolved to the HDX dataset `cbpf-allocations-and-contributions`, which is what the portal serves)

Downloaded by `Data/download.py` (stdlib only; no pip install).

### Third-party (declared external data with their own downloaders)

| Source | Role | Folder |
|---|---|---|
| [INFORM Severity Index (EU JRC DRMKC)](https://drmkc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/inform-index/INFORM-Severity/Results-and-data) | Monthly crisis severity 1–10 + 1–5 category, global, 2020-09 → present. Load-bearing for attribute `a₄` and the temporal bonus. **5,298 (country × month) rows across 109 countries**; every full-stack priority country has ≥60 months of history. | `Third-Party/DRMKC-INFORM/` |
| [IPC Population Tracking Tool](https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/population-tracking-tool/en/) | Per-unit food-security phase 1–5. Kept as a richer Afghanistan-focused backup for demo purposes (2 countries, 19 analyses). | `Third-Party/IPCInfo/` |

Each third-party folder has its own `download.py` (and for INFORM, a `consolidate.py` that produces `inform_severity_long.csv`). `./run.sh` at the repo root triggers both first-run.

## Which files the methodology actually needs

Critical for the core scoring (Phase 1 MVP):
- `hno/hpc_hno_2025.csv` (and `2024.csv` for temporal comparisons) — people in need
- `fts/fts_requirements_funding_global.csv` — country-level funding gap
- `fts/fts_requirements_funding_cluster_global.csv` — **load-bearing** for the intra-crisis equity Gini term
- `hrp/humanitarian-response-plans.csv` — plan status and requirements
- `cod-ps/cod_population_admin0.csv` — per-capita normalisation

Used for enrichment / bonus task:
- `fts/fts_incoming_funding_global.csv` — donor concentration (HHI)
- `cbpf/cbpf_project_summary.csv` — pooled fund allocations
- `cod-ps/cod_population_admin1.csv` — sub-national analysis (stretch goal)

The admin2/3/4 population files are pulled in completeness but are not required for the country-level methodology.

## Known data-audit findings

Audit run 2026-04-18, full mapping in `proposal/proposal.pdf` §4.1–4.4:

- **Severity (methodology attribute $a_4$) is NOT in HNO** — only a free-text `Description` field. Solved globally via **INFORM Severity** (EU JRC DRMKC): 67 monthly snapshots 2020-09 → present, consolidated into `Third-Party/DRMKC-INFORM/inform_severity_long.csv` (5,298 rows across 109 countries; every full-stack priority country has ≥60 months of history). IPC export retained as Afghanistan-focused backup for demo purposes. See `Third-Party/DRMKC-INFORM/download.py` + `consolidate.py`.
- **Cluster names disagree between HNO and FTS.** E.g. HNO `"Sanitation & Hygiene"` vs. FTS `"Water Sanitation and Hygiene"` vs. French `"EHA - Eau Hygiène Assainissement"`. A manual mapping table will live at `src/taxonomies/cluster_map.csv` (~20–30 entries) and is load-bearing for the equity Gini.
- **FTS incoming records sometimes span multiple destination countries** via pipe-delimited `destLocations`. HHI computation applies a lead-country rule or splits equally across listed destinations and flags the crisis as `estimated`.
- **HNO 2026 is a stub** (~7 KB, ~100 rows) — plan cycles not finalised yet. Primary analysis uses 2024 + 2025.
- **Validation benchmarks** (CERF UFE, CARE *Breaking the Silence*) are not included in the core download — they are scraped separately once per cycle.

Verdict: all six attributes recoverable from public sources; no kill blocker.

## If a download 404s

HDX resource IDs are generally stable, but if OCHA re-issues a dataset the URL hash changes. To regenerate URLs:

```bash
curl -sL "https://data.humdata.org/api/3/action/package_show?id=<slug>" | \
    python3 -c "import json,sys; [print(r['url']) for r in json.load(sys.stdin)['result']['resources']]"
```

Slugs to try: `global-hpc-hno`, `humanitarian-response-plans`, `cod-ps-global`, `global-requirements-and-funding-data`, `cbpf-allocations-and-contributions`.

Then edit the `DATASETS` list in `download.py` and re-run.
